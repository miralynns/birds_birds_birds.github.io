High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms generally use a job manager system to ensure equitable access to computing resources for multiple users.
At Boise State University, the Borah computing cluster runs submitted SBATCH files that use slurm command line.
In this section, we will breakdown slurm scripts and provide an example.

### Slurm requirements

Slurm scripts have four parts:

1.  **Shebang command** functions to interpret the UNIX commands and run the slurm script.
    This line of command is required at the top of every slurm script.

    `#!/bin/bash`

2.  **Resource request section** breakdowns the amount of resources required for the job and informs slurm of the job name, RAM requirements, number of CPUs, nodes, and many other parameters explained below.

    ```         
    #SBATCH -J --job-name
    #SBATCH -o --output 
    #SBATCH -p --partition
    #SBATCH -N --ntasks
    #SBATCH -n --cpus-per-taks
    #SBATCH -t --time
    #SBATCH --mail-type=END
    #SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN
    #SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
    #SBATCH --mail-user=EMAIL ADDRESS
    ```

    `-J`: Name of the job specified by the user.

    `-o`: Output name of the sbatch which is generally the job name followed by `.o%j`.

    `-p`: Partition request for resource allocation.
    [Borah](https://www.boisestate.edu/rcs/cluster-guides/scheduling-a-job/) specific options are `gpu`, `bsufq`, and `bigmem`.

    `-N`: Number of nodes specified for the job.

    `-n`: Number of CPU cores needed for tasks.

    `-t`: Run time limit for job.

    `--mail-type`: --mail-type is broken into `BEGIN` `END` and `FAIL`.
    These three lines function to notify the user when the job has started, ended, and/or failed.

    `--mail-user`: user email address is provided to receive job events specified above.

3.  **Dependencies** details that software/modules that are required to run the job steps.

    `module load python`

4.  **Job Step** details the module tasks required for the job.

```         
`conda active -env`Slurm Parameter Explanations
```

### Slurm script example

Below is a slurm script example we will be using to download RNA-seq files to the computing cluster.

To make comments in a bash script, we use `##`

```         
## Shebang
#!/bin/bash

## RESOURCE REQUEST
#SBATCH -J slurm_example #job name
#SBATCH -o log.o%j #log file output will be linked to the job number
#SBATCH -p bsudfq #CPU node request
#SBATCH -N 1 #One task specified
#SBATCH -n 14 #14 CPUs specified fort eh task
#SBATCH -t 14-00:00:00 #job maximum run time
#SBATCH --mail-type=END
#SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN
#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL
#SBATCH --mail-user=[insert unser EMAIL ADDRESS]

### Creating and submitting a slurm file

It is recommended to write slurm scripts in a text editor and paste when you are ready to create a job file, copy and paste the content into the terminal.
I recommend using [BBedit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/).

1.  Log into Borah

2.  Navigate to the scratch directory for your user `cd /scratch/username`

3.  Create a directory for this practice example: `mkdir slurm_practice`

4.  Navigate to the directory you just created: `cd slurm_practice`

5.  Create a job file using the `nano` command: `nano slurm_example`

    -   A text editor area will appear in the terminal (Figure 1). Paste a practice slurm script into the screen from your text editor.
    -   You are welcome to use my example job file above, but be sure to insert your email address.

    ![Figure 1. Empty nano screen. Nano is a terminal based text editor.](images/Figure_nano_screen.jpg)

6.  When ready to exit the nano screen, hold `CTL+X`.To save press `ENTER` and then `ENTER` again after confirming the name of your file.

7.  Submit your job file using the `sbatch` command: `sbatch slurm_example`

    -   You have successfully submitted your first slurm job file, great job!

    -   If you ran my example above you should receive two emails indicating that your job started and failed.

        -   This job is expected to fail because module versions might have changed and your directory does not contain the files required to run this job. A log file should appear in your slurm_example directory.
        -   For practice, view the log file using `nano` to see the job error. You can also review the log file using the `less` command.

8.  To check the progress of your job, use the following command: `squeue - u <username>`

    A resulting output will detail parameters of your job from the slurm resource request section, as well as the state of your job and the current job run time.

    Job state codes

    -   `PD - Pending`

    -   `CG - Completing`

    -   `CD - Completed`

    -   `R - Running`

    -   `F - Failed`

9.  If you need to kill a job, use the following command: `scancel <jobid>`
